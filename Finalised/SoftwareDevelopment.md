# Document Scope

This document seeks out to outline the problem which is to be solved within Practical 2 of the module GIS and Python. The deliverables will be developed within this paper and the development plan by which this will be achieved will be outlined. This document is to be updated during this process detailing testing within each stage of development.

# Introduction

In our scenario the customer is wishing to model the impact a bacterial bomb would have within a spatial domain. The bomb is to be denoted at a height of 75m and released 5000 particles. The scope of this project is to track the final resting places of these 5000 particles and display these locations to the user. This heatmap will also be exported to a csv file. 

# Deliverables

The deliverables required for this project have been split into two categories for prioritisation purposes.

### Must Haves:

The produced program should include the basic functionality in order to be considered acceptable by the customer:

*	Display the landing locations of the bacteria within a graph to the user
*	Record the landing locations of the bacteria within a .csv file
*	Application should be presented within a user-friendly GUI.
*	Application should be well commented to the standards defined within the Google style guide. http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

### Nice to Haves:

*	A dynamic GUI in which users can input their own parameters
*	A method of validating these parameters before running the program.
*	Production of a series of statistics regarding the bacteria movement
*	Web scrape the bomb location from an online resource
